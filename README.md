# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

A Machine Learning–based project that predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on academic and engagement factors using **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a supervised machine learning approach to analyze student data and predict academic outcomes.  
The model takes multiple input features related to student performance and provides a real-time prediction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts **Pass / Fail** outcome for a student
- Uses **Logistic Regression** for classification
- Trains and tests the model using real student data
- Accepts **user input** at runtime for prediction
- Prevents **duplicate data entries**
- Automatically appends new records to the dataset

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load student data using Pandas  
2. Select relevant features  
3. Split data into training and testing sets (80% / 20%)  
4. Train the Logistic Regression model  
5. Evaluate model accuracy  
6. Predict results for new student inputs
